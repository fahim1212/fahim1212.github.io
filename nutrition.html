    <h2>HEALTH EFFECTS OF VEGAN DIETS</h2>
    <p class="example-one">
      <a>Vegan diets are usually higher in dietary fiber, magnesium, folic acid, vitamins C and E, iron, and
        phytochemicals, and they tend to be lower in calories, saturated fat and cholesterol, long-chain n-3 (omega-3)
        fatty acids, vitamin D, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B-12 . In general, vegetarians typically enjoy a lower risk
        of cardiovascular disease (CVD), obesity, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers . A vegan diet appears to be useful
        for increasing the intake of protective nutrients and phytochemicals and for minimizing the intake of dietary
        factors implicated in several chronic diseases . In a recent report , different plant food groups were
        rated with respect to their metabolic-epidemiologic evidence for influencing chronic disease reduction.
        According
        to the evidence criteria of the World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization (WHO/FAO),
        cancer
        risk reduction associated with a high intake of fruit and vegetables was assessed as probable or possible, risk
        of
        CVD reduction as convincing, whereas lower risk of osteoporosis was assessed as probable . The evidence for a
        risk-reducing effect of consuming whole grains was assessed as possible for colorectal cancer and probable for
        type 2 diabetes and CVD. The evidence for a risk-reducing effect of consuming nuts was assessed as probable for
        CVD</a>

        POTENTIAL NUTRITIONAL SHORTFALLS
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <section class="section section-dark">
    <h2>The following section deals with nutrients of concern in the vegan diet. The problem of
      insufficient calcium has already been discussed in the section on bone health.</h2>
    <p class="example-one">


     <a> <b>n-3 Polyunsaturated fat</b>
      Diets that do not include fish, eggs, or sea vegetables (seaweeds) generally lack the long-chain n-3 fatty acids,
      eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3), which are important for
      cardiovascular health as well as eye and brain functions. The plant-based n-3 fatty acid α-linolenic acid (ALA;
      18:3n-3) can be converted into EPA and DHA, albeit with a fairly low efficiency. Compared with nonvegetarians,
      vegetarians, and especially vegans, tend to have lower blood concentrations of EPA and DHA. However, vegans can
      obtain DHA from microalgae supplements containing DHA, as well as from foods fortified with DHA. However, EPA can
      be obtained from the retroconversion of DHA in the body. The oil from brown algae (kelp) has also been identified
      as a good source of EPA.<br></a>

      <a>The new Dietary Reference Intakes recommend intakes of 1.6 and 1.1 g ALA/d for men and women, respectively, which
      accounts for 1% of the daily calories. Presently, the intake of EPA plus DHA in the United States is only 0.1–0.2
      g/d, with the DHA intake being ≈2–3 times the intake of EPA . Vegans should be able to easily reach the n-3 fatty
      acid requirements by including regular supplies of ALA-rich foods in their diet and also DHA-fortified foods and
      supplements. However, DHA supplements should be taken with caution. Although they can lower plasma
      triacylglycerol, they can raise total and LDL cholesterol, cause excessively prolonged bleeding times, and impair
      immune responses.<br></a>

      <a><b>Vitamin D</b>
      In the EPIC-Oxford study, vegans had the lowest mean intake of vitamin D (0.88 μg/d), a value one-fourth the mean
      intake of omnivores . For a vegan, vitamin D status depends on both sun exposure and the intake of vitamin
      D-fortified foods. Those living in areas of the world without fortified foods would need to consume a vitamin D
      supplement. Living at high latitudes can also affect one’s vitamin D status, because sun exposure in that region
      is inadequate for several months of the year. Those who are dark skinned, elderly, who extensively cover their
      body with clothing for cultural reasons, and who commonly use sunscreen are at an increased risk of vitamin D
      deficiency. Another matter of concern for vegans is that vitamin D2, the form of vitamin D acceptable to vegans,
      is substantially less bioavailable than the animal-derived vitamin D3.<br></a>

      <a>In Finland, the dietary intake of vitamin D in vegans was insufficient to maintain serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and
      parathyroid hormone concentrations within normal ranges in the winter, which appeared to have a negative effect on
      long-term BMD . Throughout the year serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were lower and parathyroid hormone
      higher in vegan women than in omnivores and other vegetarians. BMD in the lumbar region of the spine was 12% lower
      in vegans than in omnivores.<br></a>

     <a> <b>Iron</b>
      Heme iron absorption is substantially higher than non-heme iron from plant foods. However, hemoglobin
      concentrations and the risk of iron deficiency anemia are similar for vegans compared with omnivores and other
      vegetarians . Vegans often consume large amounts of vitamin C–rich foods that markedly improve the absorption of
      the nonheme iron. Serum ferritin concentrations are lower in some vegans, whereas the mean values tend to be
      similar to the mean values of other vegetarians but lower than the mean value for omnivores. The physiologic
      significance of low serum ferritin concentrations is uncertain at this time.<br></a>

      <a><b>Vitamin B-12</b>
      Compared with lactoovovegetarians and omnivores, vegans typically have lower plasma vitamin B-12 concentrations,
      higher prevalence of vitamin B-12 deficiency, and higher concentrations of plasma homocysteine . Elevated
      homocysteine has been considered a risk factor for CVD and osteoporotic bone fractures . Vitamin B-12 deficiency
      can produce abnormal neurologic and psychiatric symptoms that include ataxia, psychoses, paresthesia,
      disorientation, dementia, mood and motor disturbances, and difficulty with concentration. In addition, children
      may experience apathy and failure to thrive, and macrocytic anemia is a common feature at all ages.<br></a>

      <a><b>Zinc</b>
      Vegetarians are often considered to be at risk for zinc deficiency. Phytates, a common component of grains, seeds,
      and legumes, binds zinc and thereby decreases its bioavailability. However, a sensitive marker to measure zinc
      status in humans has not been well established, and the effects of marginal zinc intakes are poorly understood.
      Although vegans have lower zinc intake than omnivores, they do not differ from the nonvegetarians in functional
      immunocompetence as assessed by natural killer cell cytotoxic activity. It appears that there may be facilitators
      of zinc absorption and compensatory mechanisms to help vegetarians adapt to a lower intake of zinc.<br></a>

        DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OPTIMAL VEGAN DIETS
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <section class="section section-dark">

    <p class="example-one">
      <a><b>1)</b> To avoid B-12 deficiency, vegans should regularly consume vitamin B-12–fortified foods, such as
      fortified soy
      and rice beverages, certain breakfast cereals and meat analogs, and B-12–fortified nutritional yeast, or take a
      daily vitamin B-12 supplement. Fermented soy products, leafy vegetables, and seaweed cannot be considered a
      reliable source of active vitamin B-12. No unfortified plant food contains any significant amount of active
      vitamin B-12.<br></a>

     <a> <b>2)</b> To ensure adequate calcium in the diet, calcium-fortified plant foods should be regularly consumed in
      addition
      to consuming the traditional calcium sources for a vegan (green leafy vegetables, tofu, tahini). The
      calcium-fortified foods include ready-to-eat cereals, calcium-fortified soy and rice beverages, calcium-fortified
      orange and apple juices, and other beverages. The bioavailability of the calcium carbonate in the soy beverages
      and the calcium citrate malate in apple or orange juice is similar to that of the calcium in milk.
      Tricalcium phosphate–fortified soy milk was shown to have a slightly lower calcium bioavailability than the
      calcium in cow milk .<br></a>

      <a><b>3)</b> To ensure an adequate vitamin D status, especially during the winter, vegans must regularly consume
      vitamin
      D–fortified foods such as soy milk, rice milk, orange juice, breakfast cereals, and margarines that are fortified
      with vitamin D. Where fortified foods are unavailable, a daily supplement of 5–10 μg vitamin D would be necessary.
      The supplement would be highly desirable for elderly vegans.<br></a>

      <a><b>4)</b> A vegan should regularly consume plant foods naturally rich in the n-3 fatty acid ALA, such as ground
      flaxseed,
      walnuts, canola oil, soy products, and hemp seed–based beverages. In addition, it is recommended that vegans
      consume foods that are fortified with the long-chain n-3 fatty acid DHA, such as some soy milks and cereal bars.
      Those with increased requirements of long-chain n-3 fatty acids, such as pregnant and lactating women, would
      benefit from using DHA-rich microalgae supplements.<br></a>

      <a><b>5)</b> Because of the high phytate content of a typical vegan diet, it is important that a vegan consume foods
      that
      are rich in zinc, such as whole grains, legumes, and soy products, to provide a sufficient zinc intake. Benefit
      could also be obtained by vegans consuming fortified ready-to-eat cereals and other zinc-fortified foods.<br></a>
